Not sure what was needed for the Read me, but I should note that I did have some difficulties with this project. 
I ended up having to rebuild this several times to best meet the assignment, but even now, it doesn't match the example photos provided for the project.
I'm not sure how the % of change was to be calculated, but mine is displaying the change of Open to Close. 
Total Volume matches up with the examples, so it must be a misunderstanding on my part what is being used to calculate that percentage. 
Not sure what's the rule of thumb on formatting Txt files, but 1 line sentences look better to me. 

Thank you, and please be gentle haha
